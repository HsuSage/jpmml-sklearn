like	to	return
keyboard	really	worthwhile	in	usefulness	sturdy	enough	don	expect	any	problems
verizon	bills	however	difficult	to	understand	even	though	their	pricing	plans	simple
after	charging	overnight	these	batteries	work	great
won	regret
love	this	phone
disappointment
its	not	user	friendly
unfortunately	ability	to	actually	know	receiving	call	rather	important	feature	this	phone	pitiful	in	that	respect
then	exchanged	for	same	phone	even	that	had	same	problem
this	results	in	phone	being	either	stuck	at	max	volume	or	mute
this	pda	rocks
super	charged	up	for	use	as	small	hybrid	palmtop	camera	cellphone	excels	in	those	roles
would	definitely	recommend	jabra	bt250v	for	those	who	looking	for	comfort	clarity	great	price
had	verizon	years	ago	really	liked	their	service
pretty	piece	of	junk
plug	was	wrong	size
works	as	described
save	your	money	had	this	item	for	11	months	now
bad	purchase
well	im	satisfied
bose	noise	cancelling	amazing	which	very	important	for	nyc	commuter
this	battery	an	excellent	bargain
defective	crap
would	have	given	no	star	if	was	able
wear	glasses	fits	fine	with	them
sound	quality	for	device	unacceptable	unless	in	really	quiet	area	almost	hear	nothing
would	not	recommend	this	item	to	anyone
holster	that	arrived	did	not	match	photo	in	ad
great	no	problems	at	all
as	an	earlier	review	noted	plug	in	this	charger	nothing	happens
this	frog	phone	charm	adorable	very	eye	catching
never	know	if	pushed	hard	enough	or	right	number	of	times	for	function	want	or	not
sound	clear	people	talk	to	on	amazed	at	quality	too
got	aluminum	case	for	my	new	palm	vx	worked	really	well	has	protected	my	handheld	perfectly	so	far
very	good	product	well	made
mobile	phone	tools	must	have
am	very	impressed	with	job	that	motorola	did	on	sturdiness	of	this	phone
received	my	orders	well	within	shipping	timeframe	everything	was	in	good	working	order	overall	am	very	excited	to	have	this	source
phone	sturdy	waterproof
am	not	impressed	with	this	would	not	recommend	this	item	to	anyone
my	only	complaint	standard	sound	volume	little	low	even	when	turned	up	to	of
thanks	again	to	amazon	for	having	things	need	for	good	price
ended	up	sliding	on	edge	of	my	pants	or	back	pockets	instead
had	to	go	to	store	bought	new	nokia	phone	which	working	great
works	great
really	ugly
horrible	had	to	switch	times
noise	shield	incrediable
no	real	improvement
razr	battery	good	buy
keep	up	good	work	amazon
they	refuse	to	refund	or	replace
unfortunately	easy	to	accidentally	activate	them	with	gentle	touch	buttons	if	accidentally	touch	phone	to	your	face	while	listening
so	basically	threw	my	money	out	window	for	nothing
great	case	price
all	took	was	one	drop	from	about	inches	above	kitchen	counter	was	cracked	am	not	impressed	am	not	laughing
bluetooth	range	good	few	days	ago	left	my	phone	in	trunk	got	call	carried	conversation	without	hitch
small	sleek	impressive	looking	practical	setup	with	ample	storage	in	place
eargels	channel	sound	directly	into	your	ear	seem	to	increase	sound	volume	clarity
none	of	new	ones	have	ever	quite	worked	properly
am	glad	purchased
missed	numerous	calls	because	of	this	reason
perhaps	my	phone	defective	but	people	cannot	hear	me	when	use	this
don	buy	this	product
sucked	most	of	stuff	does	not	work	with	my	phone
no	shifting	no	bubbling	no	peeling	not	even	scratch	nothing	couldn	be	more	happier	with	my	new	one	for	droid
worst	software	ever	used	if	could	give	this	zero	stars	would
trying	to	make	call	on	these	an	exercise	in	frustration
case	flimsy	piece	of	plastic	has	no	front	or	side	protection	whatsoever
own	jabra	earset	was	very	happy	with	but	sound	quality	especially	outgoing	on	this	better
love	camera	really	pretty	good	quality
thank	for	such	great	service
its	total	package
seller	very	understanding	patient	would	definitely	buy	from	them	again
give	wirefly	star	will	contact	cingular	at	inform	them	of	this	practice
aggravating
great	product	for	price
have	purchased	these	for	both	family	friends	all	enjoy	their	clarity	ease	of	use
virgin	wireless	rocks	so	does	this	cheap	little	phone
none	of	works	just	don	buy
muddy	low	quality	sound	casing	around	wire	insert	was	poorly	super	glued	slid	off
please	dont	waste	your	money
all	in	all	quite	satisfied	with	this	purchase
if	looking	for	good	quality	motorola	headset	keep	looking	this	isn
yet	plantronincs	continues	to	use	same	flawed	charger	design
disapointing	results
cumbersome	design
great	was	new	packaged	nice	works	good	no	problems	came	in	less	time	then	expected
great	product
piece	of	crap
my	experience	was	terrible	this	was	my	fourth	bluetooth	headset	while	was	much	more	comfortable	than	my	last	jabra	which	hated
this	fixes	all	problems
worst	ever
am	very	happy
had	no	trouble	accessing	internet	downloading	ringtones	or	performing	any	of	functions
can	barely	ever	hear	on	am	constantly	saying	what
battery	life	highly	unacceptable
that	company	joke
does	everything	description	said	would
due	to	this	happening	on	every	call	was	forced	to	stop	using	this	headset
works	great	with	car	charger	especially	if	cannot	plug	in	two	adapters	at	same	time
verizon	tech	support	walked	my	through	few	procedures	none	of	which	worked	ended	up	having	to	do	hard	re	set	wiping	out	all	my	data
voice	quality	signal	strength	dropped	calls
plays	louder	than	any	other	speaker	of	this	size	price	so	low	that	most	would	think	quality	lacking	however	not
better	than	expected
feels	poorly	constructed	menus	difficult	to	navigate	buttons	so	recessed	that	difficult	to	push	them
battery	holding	up	well
also	difficult	to	put	on	recommend	avoiding	this	product
only	used	two	days	wasn	always	easy	to	hear	with
got	car	charger	not	even	after	week	charger	was	broken	went	to	plug	in	started	smoking
sprint	terrible	customer	service
linked	to	my	phone	without	effort
they	so	cool
easy	to	use
better	than	new
what	possesed	me	to	get	this	junk	have	no	idea
piece	of	trash
pretty	good	product
this	great	phone
for	price	on	amazon	an	excellent	product	which	would	highly	recommend
their	research	development	division	obviously	knows	what	they	re	doing
real	killer	volume	of	course	breaking
those	phones	working	just	fine	now
am	more	than	happy	with	this	product
poor	construction
this	infuriating
overall	would	recommend	this	phone	over	new	walkman
sprint	charges	for	this	service
cheap	feel	look	just	as	cheap
fits	my	ear	well	comfortable	on
doesn	work	in	europe	or	asia
clipping	this	to	your	belt	will	deffinitely	make	feel	like	50	cent	up	coming
like	design	look	of	jabra	behing	ear	headsets	5020	pretty	comfortible	to	wear	24	hours	day	without	pain	in	ear
was	amazed	at	quick	arrival	of	two	original	lg	cell	phone	batteries	at	fraction	of	price
worst	phone	from	samsung	crap	this	crappy	samsung	e715	worst	have	ever	seeen
charger	worked	for	about	week	then	completely	stopped	charging	my	phone
poor	product
however	needed	some	better	instructions
need	two	hands	to	operate	screen	this	software	interface	decade	old	cannot	compete	with	new	software	designs
worked	very	well	paired	with	treo	700w	as	skype	headset	on	my	pc	using	usb	bluetooth	transceiver
steer	clear	of	this	product	go	with	genuine	palm	replacementr	pens	which	come	in	three	pack
do	not	buy	do	not	buyit	sucks
this	great	product	sure	beats	using	your	fingers
plus	seriously	do	not	believe	worth	its	steep	price	point
all	other	cases	tried	normally	fall	apart	after	few	months	but	this	one	seems	to	be	in	for	long	haul
very	dissapointing	performance
don	make	same	mistake	that	did	please	don	buy	this	phone
this	phone	might	well	be	worst	ever	had	in	any	brand
case	was	more	or	less	an	extra	that	originally	put	on	but	later	discarded	because	scratched	my	ear
recommend	igo	to	anyone	with	different	brand	cell	phones	mp3	players	in	family
don	bother	go	to	store
posted	more	detailed	comments	under	grey	or	black	phone	but	have	fire	red	great	color
did	not	have	any	problem	with	this	item	would	order	again	if	needed
get	what	pay	for	guess
not	only	did	software	do	great	job	of	this	could	also	make	my	own	ringtones	form	my	existing	cds	without	an	internet	connection
im	surprised	this	good	quality	car	charger	there	not	much	reviews	about
these	fabulous
however	bt	headsets	currently	not	good	for	real	time	games	like	first	person	shooters	since	audio	delay	messes	me	up
used	bitpim	free	program	can	find	on	internet	to	transfer	data	to	phone	price	of	cable	was	excellent
disappointing	accessory	from	good	manufacturer
performed	awful	muffled	tinny	incoming	sound	severe	echo	for	those	on	other	end	of	call
very	wind	resistant
obviously	they	have	terrible	customer	service	so	get	what	pay	for
they	do	not	last	forever	but	not	overly	expensive	to	replace	easy	to	operate	sound	much	better	than	others	have	tried
contacted	company	they	told	me	that	although	unit	was	still	under	warranty	if	couldn	produce	my	receipt	was	out	of	luck
linksys	should	have	some	way	to	exchange	bad	phone	for	refurb	unit	or	something
phone	sturdy	as	all	nokia	bar	phones
great	phone
when	placed	my	treo	into	case	not	only	was	not	snug	but	there	was	lot	of	extra	room	on	sides
pleased
battery	terrible
found	product	to	be	easy	to	set	up	use
earpiece	on	this	too	large	or	too	heavy	keeps	falling	out	of	my	ear
utter	crap	sound	quality	terrible
charger	arrived	within	promised	timeframe	but	did	not	work
no	ear	loop	needed	tiny	sound	great
finally	after	three	or	four	times	spring	of	latch	broke	could	not	use	any	longer	on	visor
handsfree	part	works	fine	but	then	car	tries	to	download	address	book	treo	reboots	overall	still	rate	this	device	high
talk	about	useless	customer	service
felt	too	light	tinny
this	does	not	fit	palm	tungsten	e2	broke	first	time	tried	to	plug	in
happy	about	this	purchase	good	quality	low	price
love	look	feel	of	samsung	flipphones
its	well	designed	very	sharp	blue	very	nice	color
does	everything	should	more
could	not	recommend	these	more
nice	sound
looks	good	in	picture	but	this	case	was	huge	disappointment
much	less	than	jawbone	was	going	to	replace	with
setup	went	very	smoothly
its	extremely	slow	takes	forever	to	do	anything	with
must	study	for	anyone	interested	in	worst	sins	of	industrial	design
first	thing	that	happened	was	that	tracking	was	off
well	made	easy	to	access	phone	has	handy	detachable	belt	clip
then	had	to	continue	pairing	periodically	since	somehow	kept	dropping
can	upload	ringtones	from	third	party
bluetooth	does	not	work	phone	locks	up	screens	just	flash	up	now	just	makes	calls	randomly	while	in	my	pocket	locked
truly	awful
works	fine	on	my	motorola	325	cellphone	lot	better	than	worn	out	battery	did
volume	for	ringer	real	good	have	choices	how	loud
none	of	tones	acceptable
camera	color	balance	awful
this	product	clearly	not	ready	for	prime	time	don	care	how	cool	looks	if	can	tell	call	coming	in	worthless
love	ringtones	because	they	so	upbeat
chinese	forgeries	abound
easy	to	pair	with	my	samsung	cell
instructions	didn	explain	that	microphone	jack	could	be	used
would	advise	to	not	purchase	this	item	never	worked	very	well
too	bad	have	to	pay	up	to	month	for	service
works	well
nokia	ca	42	usb	cable	did	not	work	with	my	phone
clear	crisp	sound
have	to	use	smallest	earpieces	provided	but	stays	on	pretty	well
biggest	complaint	have	battery	drains	superfast
design	might	be	ergonomic	in	theory	but	could	not	stand	having	these	in	my	ear
do	not	buy	if	want	to	use	holster
phone	can	also	take	great	pictures	even	video	clips
doesn	make	look	cool
because	both	ears	occupied	background	not	distracting	at	all
comfortable	fit	need	your	headset	to	be	comfortable	for	at	least	an	hour	at	time	if	not	for	an	entire	day
also	phone	doesn	seem	to	accept	anything	except	cbr	mp3s	preferably	ripped	by	windows	media	player
can	beat	price	on	these
comes	with	strong	light	that	can	use	to	light	up	your	camera	shots	even	flash	sos	signals	seriously
lightweight	works	well
so	just	beware
love	this	cable	allows	me	to	connect	any	mini	usb	device	to	my	pc
so	anyone	near	will	hear	part	of	your	conversation
this	cool	because	most	cases	just	open	there	allowing	screen	to	get	all	scratched	up
bought	this	phone	as	replacement	for	my	startac	have	regretted	since
appears	to	actually	outperform	original	battery	from	china	that	came	with	my	v325i
can	store	anything	but	phone	numbers	to	sim
lasts	less	than	3o	minutes	if	actually	try	to	use	phone	my	wife	has	same	phone	with	same	problem
poor	quality
jabra	ear	gels	best
not	worth
phone	crashed	completely	now	have	to	get	replaced
quit	working	after	used	for	about	18	months	so	just	purchased	another	one	because	this	best	headset	ever	owned
unfortunately	will	not	recharge	my	iphone	4s	despite	connecting	from	multiple	power	sources	imac	external	battery	wall	outlet	etc
was	great	phone
if	simply	want	small	flip	phone	look	elsewhere	as	extra	bells	whistles	mediocre
good	value	works	fine	power	via	usb	car	or	wall	outlet
my	phone	doesn	slide	around	my	car	now	grip	prevents	my	phone	from	slipping	out	of	my	hand
this	simply	best	bluetooth	headset	for	sound	quality
think	over	when	plan	to	own	this	one	this	sure	last	moto	phone	for	me
in	span	of	an	hour	had	two	people	exclaim	whoa	that	new	phone	on	tv
have	always	used	corded	headsets	freedom	from	wireless	very	helpful
this	case	has	passed	one	year	mark	while	shows	signs	of	wear	100	functional
other	than	that	leather	nice	soft	fit	very	tight	cut	out	for	face	good	shape
has	everything	need	couldn	ask	for	more
after	receiving	using	product	for	just	days	broke
this	product	great	makes	working	lot	easier	can	go	to	copier	while	waiting	on	hold	for	something
none	of	three	sizes	they	sent	with	headset	would	stay	in	my	ears
mobile	has	best	customer	service	anywhere
arrived	quickly	much	less	expensive	than	others	being	sold
have	tried	units	they	both	failed	within	months	pros
provides	good	protection	looks	classy	too
krussel	always	good
tracfonewebsite	user	friendly	makes	easy	toactivate	etc
design	very	good
great	reception	all	time
would	highly	recommend	this	product
couldn	use	unit	with	sunglasses	not	good	in	texas
dit	not	work	most	of	time	with	my	nokia	5320
bought	mainly	for	charger	which	broke	soon	after	purchasing
if	like	loud	buzzing	to	override	all	your	conversations	then	this	phone	for
fantastic	buy	will	get	again	for	whatever	my	next	phone
stay	away	from	this	store	be	careful
this	blueant	supertooth	hands	free	phone	speaker	awesome
does	not	fit
item	arrived	quickly	works	great	with	my	metro	pcs	samsung	sch	r450	slider	phone	sony	premium	sound	in	ear	plugs
light	has	plenty	of	battery	capacity	very	confortable	to	wear	for	somewhat	extended	periods	of	time
disappointing
blue	ant	easy	to	use
cheap	but	hey	works	was	pleasantly	suprised	given	low	cost	of	this	item
camera	on	phone	may	be	used	as	dustpan	when	indoors	rather	be	using	disposable	then	this
then	few	days	later	puff	of	smoke	came	out	of	phone	while	in	use
very	convenient	simple	to	use	gets	job	done	makes	car	ride	so	much	smoother
nano	stated	my	son	was	dissapointed
sound	quality	excellent	as	well
its	best	headset	have	used
would	not	reccommend
they	have	been	around	for	years	carries	highest	quality	of	anti	glare	screen	protector	that	have	found	to	date
just	what	wanted
this	particular	model	would	not	work	with	my	motorola	smartphone
wont	work	right	or	atleast	for	me
in	addition	feels	amp	looks	as	if	phone	all	lightweight	cheap	plastic
but	now	that	out	of	warranty	same	problems	reoccure	bottom	line	put	your	money	somewhere	else	cingular	will	not	support
really	wanted	plantronics	510	to	be	right	one	but	has	too	many	issues	for	me	good
great	product
crisp	clear
after	first	charge	kept	going	dead	after	12	minutes
very	cheap	plastic	creaks	like	an	old	wooden	floor
get	absolutely	horrible	reception	in	my	apartment	where	with	other	phones	have	not	had	this	problem
reception	has	been	generally	good
excellent	sound	battery	life	inconspicuous	to	boot
great	bluetooth
highly	recommend	this	case
worthwhile
this	great	deal
after	my	phone	got	to	be	about	year	old	been	slowly	breaking	despite	much	care	on	my	part
am	sorry	made	this	purchase
bought	these	hoping	could	make	my	bluetooth	headset	fit	better	but	these	things	made	impossible	to	wear
treo	mobile	refused	to	replace	again	forced	me	to	buy	another	phone	without	any	kind	of	upgrade	discount
was	horrible
don	think	would	hold	too	securly	on	your	belt
this	allows	possibility	of	double	booking	for	same	date	time	after	first
they	work	about	weeks	then	break
simple	to	use	like
great	tool	for	entertainment	communication	data	management	oh	be	sure	to	use	activesync	for	optimal	data	synchronization	results
can	use	this	case	because	smell	disgusting
not	what	wanted
own	of	these	cases	would	order	another
great	phone
bought	this	battery	with	coupon	from	amazon	very	happy	with	my	purchase
internet	access	was	fine	rare	instance	that	worked
perfect	for	ps3
five	star	plus	plus
good	quality	bargain	bought	this	after	bought	cheapy	from	big	lots	that	sounded	awful	people	on	other	end	couldn	hear	me
50	down	drain
tried	talking	real	loud	but	shouting	on	telephone	gets	old	was	still	told	wasn	great
good	works	fine
for	price	this	was	great	deal
great	price	too
if	there	wind	completely	useless
yes	shiny	on	front	side	love
does	not	work
at	first	thought	was	grtting	good	deal	at	44	until	plugged	into	my	phone	v3c	razr
reception	through	this	headset	excellent
thumbs	up	to	this	seller
have	verizon	lg	phone	they	work	well	together	good	reception	range	that	exceeds	20	feet	line	of	sight
improper	description	had	to	return
works	comfortable
battery	charge	life	quite	long
jabra	eargels	fit	my	ears	very	well
battery	has	no	life
checked	everywhere	there	no	feature	for	which	really	disappointing
product	exactly	as	described
gets	signal	when	other	verizon	phones	won
doesn	do	job
would	recommend
plan	on	ordering	from	them	again	again
that	being	said	for	phone	camera	very	nice	many	cool	effects	to	play	with	video	decent	as	well
have	been	very	satisfied	with	this	cell	phone	from	day	one
they	keep	getting	better	better	this	my	third	one	had	numerous	palms	too
awkward	to	use	unreliable
shipping	time	was	also	very	quick
not	as	good	as	had	hoped
good	case
doesn	work
really	good	product
unfortunately	did	not	work
all	three	broke	within	two	months	of	use
dont	buy
my	father	has	v265	battery	dying
however	ear	pads	come	off	easily	after	only	one	week	lost	one
calls	drop	phone	comes	on	off	at	will	screen	goes	black	worst	of	all	stops	ringing	intermittently
horrible	horrible	protector
don	like	this	nokia	either
reaching	for	bottom	row	uncomfortable	send	end	keys	not	where	expect	them	to	be
have	bought	this	nokia	cell	phone	few	weeks	ago	was	nightmare
would	take	too	long	to	describe	how	bad	my	customer	service	experience	has	been	with	amazon
only	very	disappointing	thing	was	there	was	no	speakerphone
terrible	my	car	will	not	accept	this	cassette
product	useless	since	does	not	have	enough	charging	current	to	charge	cellphones	was	planning	to	use	with
not	what	says
stay	away	from
used	dirty
very	unreliable	service	from	mobile
not	good	enough	for	price
bought	two	of	them	neither	will	charge
looks	very	nice
this	an	excellent	tool	especially	when	paired	with	your	phone	auto	answer
have	read	other	reviews	here	but	haven	had	any	problem	with
these	products	cover	up	important	light	sensor	above	ear	outlet
comfortable	in	my	hand
just	does	not	work
poor	reliability
works
if	take	picture	battery	drops	bar	starts	beeping	letting	me	know	its	dieing
terrible	product	waste	of	money
last	time	buying	from
was	waste	of	my	money
so	far	has	worked	like	charm
have	only	had	for	few	weeks	but	so	far	so	good
but	in	any	case	best	part	can	download	these	pictures	to	your	laptop	using	ir	or	even	send	pictures	from	your	laptop	to	phone
would	recommend	this	item
been	my	choice	headset	for	years	great	sound	good	volume	good	noise	cancellation
nice	case	feels	good	in	your	hands
item	received	was	counterfeit
just	really	good	so	far	probably	best	bt	headset	have	ever	had
works	fine
received	my	headset	in	good	time	was	happy	with
was	very	pleased	to	see	that	could	replace	my	well	travled	swivel	holster	for	my	blackberry	flip
my	sister	has	one	also	she	loves
good	quality
this	by	far	worst	purchase	made	on	amazon
excellent	dual	purpose	headset
excellent
does	not	work	for	listening	to	music	with	cingular	8125
seems	completely	secure	both	holding	on	to	my	belt	keeping	iphone	inside
bottowm	line	another	worthless	cheap	gimmick	from	sprint
having	trouble	with	volume
only	good	thing	was	that	fits	comfortably	on	small	ears
warning	do	not	buy
am	pairing	this	with	my	iphone	could	not	be	happier	with	so	far
when	opens	battery	connection	broken	device	turned	off
didn	want	clip	going	over	top	of	my	ear	causing	discomfort
best	headset	ever
don	trust	their	website	don	expect	any	helpful	support
was	that	loud	glad	to	say	that	plantronics	510	maintains	flawless	connection	to	my	cell	with	no	static	during	normal	use
speaker	of	low	quality	so	as	making	ring	tones	sound	very	cheap
fits	comfortably	came	with	three	sizes	of	earbud	tips
excellent	product	for	price
bad	reception
this	product	very	high	quality	chinese	crap
was	quite	comfortable	in	ear
great	phone
don	buy	this	product	fails
everything	about	this	product	wrong	first
pairing	of	two	devices	was	so	easy	barely	took	couple	minutes	before	started	making	calls	with	voice	dialing	feature
this	was	utterly	confusing	at	first	which	caused	me	to	lose	couple	of	very	very	important	contacts
terrible	phone	holder
cutouts	buttons	placed	perfectly
love	being	able	to	use	one	headset	for	both	by	land	line	cell
problem	that	ear	loops	made	of	weak	material	break	easily
not	nearly	as	good	looking	as	amazon	picture	makes	look
but	despite	these	few	flaws	this	case	of	exceptional	quality	well	worth	additional	costs	of	owning	an	official	oem	product
how	stupid	that
can	hear	while	driving	in	car	usually	don	even	have	to	put	on	loudest	setting
seller	shipped	quickly	much	cheaper	than	competitors
good	show	samsung
so	bought	about	10	of	these	saved	alot	of	money
always	cuts	out	makes	beep	beep	beep	sound	then	says	signal	failed
couldn	figure	out
my	phone	sounded	ok	not	great	ok	but	my	wife	phone	was	almost	totally	unintelligible	she	couldn	understand	word	being	said	on
so	had	to	take	battery	out	of	phone	put	all	back	together	then	restart
while	managed	to	bend	leaf	spring	back	in	place	metal	now	has	enough	stress	that	will	break	on	next	drop
leopard	print	wonderfully	wild
works	for	me
saggy	floppy	piece	of	junk
much	better	than	hard	plastic	cases
also	had	new	problem
happy	so	far
cool	phone
works	good
motorola	finally	got	voice	quality	of	bluetooth	headset	right
looses	connection	to	phone	even	when	within	couple	feet	between	two
but	great	would	really	recommend
makes	easier	to	keep	up	with	my	bluetooth	when	not	wearing
as	said	above	pretty	useless
never	got
this	pair	of	headphones	worst	that	have	ever	had	sound	wise
down	drain	because	of	weak	snap
does	not	charge	cingular	att	8525	phone
get	extra	minutes	so	that	can	carry	out	call	not	get	cut	off
however	after	about	year	fliptop	started	to	get	loose	wobbly	eventually	my	screen	went	black	couldn	receive	place	calls
kept	catching	cable	on	seat	had	to	pull	phone	out	to	turn	on	an	off
headset	fulfills	my	requirements	so	am	happy	with	my	purchase
logitech	bluetooth	headset	10
like	fact	that	rests	lightly	against	your	ear	rather	than	inside
lot	of	websites	have	been	rating	this	very	good	phone	so	do
have	tried	these	cables	with	my	computer	my	ipod	works	just	fine
mic	there	joke	volume	quite	low
returning	them
does	not	maintain	connection	with	computer	while	on	my	lap
easy	to	turn	on	off	when	in	car	volume	controls	quite	accessable
have	had	mine	for	about	year	this	christmas	bought	some	for	rest	of	family
otherwise	easy	to	install	use	clear	sound
nice	leather
had	to	purchase	different	case
joy	to	use
very	much	disappointed	with	this	company
very	satisifed	with	that
didn	charge	for	me
this	phone	to	get	for	2005	just	bought	my	s710a	all	can	say	wow
buttons	too	small
just	reading	on	specs	alone	makes	say	wow
love	great	armband
really	like	this	product	over	motorola	because	allot	clearer	on	ear	piece	mic
however	keypads	so	tinny	that	sometimes	reach	wrong	buttons
exchanged	sony	ericson	z500a	for	this	pretty	happy	with	that	decision
was	very	impressed	with	price	of	cases
also	makes	easier	to	hold	on	to
use	this	product	in	motor	control	center	where	there	lot	of	high	voltage	humming	from	equipment	works	great
pretty	easy
cannot	make	calls	at	certain	places
however	my	girl	was	complain	that	some	time	phone	doesn	wake	up	like	normal	phone	does
beautiful	styling	though
this	company	charge	me	restocking	fee	still	not	given	me	my	refund	back
trying	to	return	for	refund
plugged	in	only	to	find	out	not	darn	thing	worked
excellent	product
earbud	piece	breaks	easily
lousy	product
this	phone	tries	very	hard	to	do	everything	but	fails	at	very	ability	to	be	phone
best	charger	have	seen	on	market	yet
sweetest	phone
oh	charger	seems	to	work	fine
fits	so	securely	that	ear	hook	does	not	even	need	to	be	used	sound	better	directed	through	your	ear	canal
not	enough	volume
echo	problem	very	unsatisfactory
could	only	take	videos	at	time	quality	was	very	poor
don	waste	your	money
am	going	to	have	to	be	first	to	negatively	review	this	product
adapter	does	not	provide	enough	charging	current
there	was	so	much	hype	over	this	phone	that	assumed	was	best	my	mistake
also	cannot	take	pictures	with	in	case	because	lense	covered
phone	falls	out	easily
didn	work	people	can	not	hear	me	when	talk
text	messaging	feature	really	tricky	to	use
really	disappointed	all	have	now	charger	that	doesn	work
painful	on	ear
lasted	one	day	then	blew	up
disappointed
kind	of	flops	around
screen	does	get	smudged	easily	because	touches	your	ear	face
what	piece	of	junk	lose	more	calls	on	this	phone
item	does	not	match	picture
only	thing	that	disappoint	me	infra	red	port	irda
can	not	answer	calls	with	unit	never	worked	once
